# Solutions to Coding Assignment: Design Patterns & Mars Rover Simulation

This repository contains solutions to two  programming exercises, demonstrating the use of design patterns and implementing a Mars Rover simulation. Each solution is contained within its respective folder, organized as follows:

## Folder Overview

- **Exersice_1**: This directory includes the solutions for the first exercise, where various software design patterns are implemented and demonstrated through Java code.
  
- **MarsRover**: This directory contains a terminal-based simulation for a Mars Rover. The simulation allows the rover to navigate across a grid-based terrain as part of the Mars Rover Programming Exercise.
