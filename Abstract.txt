**Abstract**

TeachMate is a chatbot designed to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses using Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The project is built for educational purposes, aiming to assist users—students, educators, and researchers—in quickly accessing precise information from large volumes of academic or informational PDF content. The process includes advanced text extraction and processing, employing libraries such as PyPDF2 and pdfplumber. Through efficient multiprocessing and semantic splitting, TeachMate utilizes sentence transformers to embed and cluster extracted text, allowing for meaningful content segmentation. Additionally, clustering algorithms like Agglomerative Clustering are leveraged to identify and group semantically related paragraphs, enabling precise information retrieval and improved response quality. The chatbot's context-aware answers enhance user interaction and facilitate effective information access across various educational and research domains.
